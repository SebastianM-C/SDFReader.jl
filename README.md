[EPOCH](https://cfsa-pmw.warwick.ac.uk/mediawiki/index.php/EPOCH:FAQ) is a code for plasma physics simulations using the Particle-in-Cell method. The simulation results are written is `.sdf` binary files. Several readers for this files are available at https://cfsa-pmw.warwick.ac.uk/SDF. This package intends to be another reader for the `.sdf` file type.

## Quick start

Install the package using
```
]add SDFReader
```

Assuming that you have a folder with `.sdf` files generated from
an EPOCH simulation, use `read_simulation` to read the metadata
for the simulation. You can index into the resulting object and access
individual simulation files. Note that by default EPOCH starts indexing
form 0, while in Julia we usually start from 1.

```julia
using SDFReader

dir = "my_simulation"
sim = read_simulation(dir)
sim[1] # corresponds to the first sdf file (usually 0000.sdf).
```

With the `keys` function you can observe what data was saved in the
simulation. The symbols correspond to the names used for the
saved variables. Note that some identifiers used by EPOCH, such
as the ones for species properties are not valid julia symbols
(such as `px/electron`), so instead you can use strings (e.g. `"px/electron"`).

```julia
keys(sim[1])
```

In order to read the data for scalar field quantities such as `:ex` or `"px/electron"`,
you can simply index into the file

```julia
file = sim[1]
Ex = file[:ex]
```
The returned object will be a `ScalarField` (or `ScalarVariable` for the components
of particle variables such as `"px/electron"`) and will contain the information
regarding the data (with units via [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl/))
and the corresponding coordinate values.
These objects are `AbstractArrays` and via indexing you can access the stored values.

You can use broadcasting to compute derived quantities. For example, to compute the
x component of the angular momentum you can simply use
```julia
function compute_Lx(file)
    w, r, py, pz = file["weight/electron",
                        "grid/electron",
                        "py/electron",
                        "pz/electron"]

    y = r[2]
    z = r[3]
    Lx = @. w * (y * pz - z * py)
end
```

You can also acces the (simulation) time corresponding to a file with
```julia
get_time(file)
```
and also the parameters from the `input.deck` file with `get_parameter`.
The `input.deck` parser only supports simple `key=value` expressions (no arithmetic operations or function calls).
You can also access nested values by providing a second argument.
```julia
nx = get_parameter(file, :nx)
Î» = get_parameter(file, :laser, :lambda)
```
